* JWT Authentication: Using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication is a popular approach for securing web applications. It allows you to verify the identity of users and control access to different sections of your site.

Admins usually have additional features for managing the restaurant, while normal users can perform actions like placing orders, viewing menus, etc.

* Payment Section: Including a payment section for users to make payments via card is essential for online transactions. It's important to implement proper security measures to ensure the safety of users' payment information, such as using HTTPS, PCI DSS compliance, and tokenizing sensitive card details.

* Login Section with Captcha: Including a captcha in the login section is a recommended practice to prevent automated bots from attempting to log in or perform malicious activities. It adds an additional layer of security to protect user accounts.
